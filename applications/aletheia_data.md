### Overview

Please provide the following:
  
  * A project name: Aletheia Data

  * A brief description of your project:

  Aletheia is an Open Source project that seeks to encourage both public and private entities to facilitate access to public information, so that it can have a more relevant social impact.

  As developers, we have seen the need to make use of public information (information in the public domain that should be available and accessible by law), but in the search we quickly realized that although the information is (in part) available, it is not organized in a way that is easy to use (uses that can range from the simple consultation of the data, to statistical use or to create computer smart products oriented to citizens.

  Another problem that we frequently find is the lack of a standard in the format of these files. As well as the use of formats that DO NOT allow the extraction of the information. We know that, like us, there are other Citizens who need to access this data and this is why we decided to develop an Open API to facilitate access and distribution of resourceful public information.

  Our objective is to create an ecosystem where public datasets are ALWAYS available, accessible 24 hours a day and accompanied by APIs to facilitate consumption and exchange of this information while providing an immutable and reliable "single source of truth".

  * An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Crust.

  We'd like to integrate Crust decentralized storage solution to offer our users the most complete suite of decentralize storage services in the Web3. Currently, we're working with IPFS, but in our roadmap we have integrations with Aweave, Storj, and hopefully Crust too. 

  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

  We're passioned developers looking to solve a big problem in our country (Dominican Republic). Public information is handled almost exclusively by the government, but this frequently removes files, change their content, or simply require additional steps to access public data. We aim to solve that by storing our precious datasets in decentralized storage, and providing tools to access and use this valuable datasets.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (with urls or IPFS file CIDs included) at following :

* Mockups/designs of any UI components

* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

https://docs.aletheiadata.org/

* An overview of the technology stack to be used

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xCebirfcyv_hGCYg4WgBxV3raZXLrY4uH9GKO4K9YwQ/edit?usp=sharing

* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

https://docs.aletheiadata.org/

* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

We're currently in BETA. Our user interface can be found at:
https://app.aletheiadata.org/

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

We want to make it simpler for users, data scientists, and journalists to find and use valuable public data, as well as guarantee its integrity and availability. 

* What need(s) does your project meet? 

- Promoting usage of common goods like public datasets
- Providing a censorship-resistent infrastructure for public datasets
- Providing ways to interact with these data

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? 
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

  In the DR there's none, in Web3 there are many solutions for data storage and management, but haven't found any specifically related to public datasets.

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting code commits made by team members in past projects. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful. 

**Enzo** is an experienced Software Engineer who has worked for companies in the US and Europe. He's being in Web2 for more than 6 years developing solutions for Startups and Middle sized companies. His experience in Web2, most specifically in Cloud computing, had brought his to migrate to Web3.0 last year, and work in the field since then. After changing industry, Enzo started working on migrating Aletheia to Web3 (initially it was a Web App on AWS), and integrating Web2/3 tools to accomplish our mission.

**Natacha** is a software developer with over 6 of experience. With her wide range of experience and skills, she's quite capable of translating design and requirements into a solid, scalable application. She has an extensive experience programming in JavaScript using React, NodeJS with Typescript. She has been working with Web3 related technology like Solidity, TheGraph, and frameworks such as Hardhat in the last 1-2 years.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below, we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to IPFS/Crust. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

Please include here

- In short-term we are planning to make Aletheia a valuable options for journalists, data scientists and regular user who want to keep their data safe without incurring into any costs to the final user. To do this, we've decided to keep all our tooling open source and free. In the next version of the dApp, we'll introduce Data NFTs which will provide financial stability to the ecosystem as well as promoting common goods investments. 

- In long-term we are planning to build a solid and well respected solutions for public data integrity. Meaning, we'd like to promote our technology stack and tools to incentive public and private entities to take advantage of our system.

## Additional Information 

Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:

We have applied and got accepted into the [Filecoin - Open-Grant-Program](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/394#issuecomment-982623736). Our application for this grant is similar but different in milestone deliveries, and needs. We're currently working on this application grant as well as applying for other dStorage solutions integration. We want this application to be more about a standard layer to help developers and users securely store valuable public datasets. While our application to the Open-Grant-Program focus more on the front-end and back-end implementations, this applications will focus exclusively on Crust integration to Aletheia's system.
