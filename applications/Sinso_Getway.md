### Overview

  * Sinso Getway is a medical data aggregator based on Crust and IPFS, especially including the front-end display API interface for medical imaging data. Sinso Getway can upgrade traditional medical business data to Web 3.0. Using Sinso getway can quickly develop a medical industry standard electronic film system based on CRUST. 

### Project Details 
*  **Core features****：**

  | **#** | **Description**                                              |
  | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 1     | Support mobile browsing of cloud  service of electronic films and reports associated with patient medical image  via QR codes |
  | 2     | Support mobile application browsing  service API based on CRUST distributed storage |
  | 3     | Supports the filing and arrangement of  electronic films and reports, and supports the mobile terminal to browse  patient electronic films and reports by directly turning pages, using the  plug-in-free H5 mode. |
  | 4     | Supports mobile terminal downloading  and browsing services of DICOM images, supports mobile terminal browsing  images, and has functions such as measurement, labeling, window width bed  adjustment, positioning line, etc. |
  | 5     | Support the encrypted storage of  patient data to avoid leakage of patient privacy and improve information  security protection |
  | 6     | Support  mobile terminal to read DICOM images, zoom in and out, measurement, window  width and window level adjustment, dynamic playback and other functions |
  | 7     | Reserve  privacy data pre-processing and pre-data classification functions. |

  *The minimum feasible DEMO we provide will use this Sinso Getway component, which is a very concise and practical case.

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- - Where and how does your      project fit into the ecosystem?

**IPFS cluster gateway on Development Tool Layer.**

- - What need(s) does your project      meet?

**Providing Helping users to pin their files in IPFS and Crust network.**

- - Are there any other projects      similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem?

[Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) is a multitiered file storage API built on Filecoin and IPFS, and an index builder for Filecoin data. IceTrays provides a more reliable and easy-to-used service because it is decentralized and its nodes store file path message.Team
