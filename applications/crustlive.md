### Overview
  * Description: Most of people use centralized video sharing platforms and they are satisfied with that, but up to one day they realized that they are hardly controlled by incognito algorithms and decisions of the management board behind these platforms. It's easy to realize how dictatorial the centralized platforms are from the recent political events in 2020. Crust Live was created as an open-source video sharing platform based on Crust distributed network to offer a solution opposed to conventional platforms:
    * Video hosting ressources: Crust Live is based on distributed storage networks (e.g Crust Network) which is an emerging solution to reduce the power of centralized storage companies. Distributed strorage offers cheap, controllable solution but there are not much show cases for public audience. Crust Live is a complement component in the very early stage of distributed storage era.
    * Censorship-free
    * Non-profit: most decisions that lead people to the controlled situation come from the profit. Crust Live uses cheap, distributed storage ressources (even cheaper in the future since hardware is becoming cheaper and get double capacity every 2 years according to Moore's law) therefore it does not require a huge amount of money to maintain the platform. The profit that is used to maintain the platform come from the donation and advertisement.
  * How do we make: The idea is clear and simple, Crust Live is built on nodejs.
  * Why do we make this platform: We experienced multiple protocols of distributed content sharing such as bitTorrent, IPFS, Lbry,... The idea of distributed storage is interessting but the content would disappear if there are not nodes that keep them. Many distributed networks come to resolve that issue such as Crust Network, Filecoin, Sia, Storj,... but the show case is still very limited, public audience is not aware of such networks. People get attention to these names just for "investment" (in other word: speculation) purpose. We believes that distributed storage is in very early stage and it will be much more popular in the future since people is now aware of censorship they got from centralized platforms. Crust Live is an easy-to-understand show case for distributed network.

### Ecosystem Fit 

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

Sia.tech is a working platform for a long time but until the moment public people don't use it to store their files. Distributed storage in general doesn't have much use cases where people can trust and put their personal data on it. Crust.live is the place where people can share their public videos and experience how easy and powerful a distributed storage system has. What people are worrying the most about when using distributed storage platforms is its privacy and its stability. Crust Live can convince people about the stability by showing that their videos (in other word: their data) are always playable with high speed and low latency on Crust.Network.


* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? 

Lbry has their own video sharing platform https://odysee.com/ (previously lbry.tv) It's not fully distributed because the contents are guaranteed by private Lbry nodes. Public nodes don't have incentive to keep their nodes alive. Odysee has more than 15M visits each month. People start using distributed video sharing platform because they care more and more about the cencorship.

D.tube is a distributed video sharing blockchain, this project is awesome but the weakest point of the project is that people should be responsable for the storage of their videos. This project could work for a certain amount of people but for public audience it doesn't work. I made a survey with my friends who are engineers in IT fields, they are not aware about distributed storage protocols and distributed storage platforms, so asking them to store videos themself without using centralized platforms is a diffucult mission.


  * If so, how is your project different?
  
Crust Live was built by Crust Network supporters therefore it's for Crust Network first. Crust Live is trully decentralized and is maintained by donation and advertisement.
