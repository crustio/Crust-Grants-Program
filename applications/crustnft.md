### Overview

CrustNFT is a mint tool that mainly aims at following audience:

- Indie NFT creators: CrustNFT provides multiple blockchain choices, decentralized metadata storage, and connects to multiple tradeplaces like OpenSea, OpenDAO, Showme, etc.
- ‘10K’ NFT creators and minters (mainstream use case in current NFT space): CrustNFT provides a 100% code-free tool to support creators to create 10K NFT collections and minters to mint.
- NFT Collectors: CrustNFT provides a one-stop place to manage all NFT collections and assets across all chains and platforms.

## Project Details

1. CrustNFT is open source, and will be operated by a community-owned DAO in the long term.

    - crustnft.io team (potentially could be a company) is going to carry on any decision from the DAO, and be funded by the DAO, like OpenDAO (SOS - for now totally offchain governance, not really accontable) and Uniswap (UNI - most of parameters on chain for governance).

    - DAO token will capture any business value of CrustNFT as described in the following items. And in future to capture any additional value as decided from DAO.

2. CrustNFT users pay their own cryptotoken to deploy NFT collection smart contracts and mint NFT (like ETH/MATIC). Yet in addition CrustNFT runs following pricing model:

    - CrustNFT supports artists (creators) to create basic collections within each up to 10 NFT asset mints; or premium collections within each up to 10000 NFT asset mints.
    - Artists (creators) are free to create basic collections.
    - Artist (creator) can pay to buy a package of premium collections creation, paid in different cryptocurrency and discounts. E.g. Artist can pay $10 to buy the package to mint 1 premium collections; or $80 (with 20% price off) to buy the package to mint 10 premium collections.
    - [Potential but big] For ‘10K’ type of NFT collections, CrustNFT charges commission for NFT minters.

3. Additional service with potential business values and the value will also be captured in DAO:
    - API service for developers/applications to query NFT data.
    - Bridging service commission (to accept multiple types of cryptocurrency).
    - Ads
