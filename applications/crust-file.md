## Project Details

1. Start IPFS node in the app, 
2. User choose one file to share or trade, the file will be put to IPFS local node
3. Then in the local file manager, user can choose some files to share or set them a price (for example 1 CRUST TOKEN)
4. User navigate the file, and can pay to get the price.

## Ecosystem Fit

  Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

  * Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

   The app is a try on file market based on IPFS + CRUST.
   In the future, we will try to combine this with the NFT.  

  * What need(s) does your project meet? 
   Helping users to share their files in IPFS and Crust network in mobile app.
   To complete our project, we will develop several sdk, like java sdk, js and some other apis that can be used by other teams.

  * Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? ## Team
