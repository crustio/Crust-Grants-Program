# Crust Grant Proposal

**Project Name:** Alphaday \
**Team Name:** Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd. \
**Payment Address:** 0x48e239Fa0B364Cd92Fc750A50045c9f9E04DD781 \
**Receivable Token:** USDT

### Overview

Project name: Alphaday \
Brief description: \
Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI. \
Relation to Crust and our interest in building for Crust: \
We’ve conducted market research on users and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

Having all the information in one place allows Crust Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily stay up to date on Crust Network ecosystem updates, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general, users who can track their favourite projects more easily stay more engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. 

### Project Details 

Our product is already live at : https://app.alphaday.com 

Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

### Ecosystem Fit 

Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? \
Social- A data aggregator as a Community dashboard.

What need(s) does your project meet? \
Our desired outcome is to provide a new end-point for community engagement and to bolster Crust Network’s outreach. \
Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem? If so, how is your project different? \
Alphaday has no direct competitors as it aims to recreate a crypto user’s daily workflow (i.e. their general experience) inside a single dashboard. i.e. if a Crust Network ecosystem participant wakes up, checks their portfolio, reads twitter, browses the Crust Network governance forum, listens to the latest podcast featuring Crust Network team members,  does a bit of on-chain research, instead of having this workflow spread across a dozen tabs, it’s all available within a single screen on Alphaday.

His co-founder, Felipe, has also been involved in Ethereum since 2016 and was a Developer Advocate at Pegasys and Consensys before quitting to work full time on Alphaday.

## Development Roadmap

### Overview 
**Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months for initial deployment, 12 months of continuous maintenance. \
**Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1 FTE \
**Total Costs:** 2,640 USDT

### Milestone 1 — Initial development and deployment of dashboard. 
**Estimated Duration:** 2 months \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,320 USDT

We would like to create a Crust Network ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Blog | The latest Crust Network official announcements and blog post content |
| 2. | News | A feed of all news mentions of Crust Network from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet. |
| 3. | Calendar | A calendar containing all Crust Network events including Crust Network Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Crust Network bounties, AMAs. | 
| 4. | Podcasts | Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Crust Network team members. |  
| 5. | Videos | Youtube stream containing educational Crust Network content. |  
| 6. | Wiki & Documents | Crust Network Wiki & Documents directory. |  
| 7. | Social Media | Twitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions. |  
| 8. | Other Info | FAQ, Economic & Tech Whitepapers and CSM Lightpaper, CRU tokenomics information. |  
| 9. | Devs & Builders | Grants and Bounties links with descriptions and other resources to guide devs and builders. |  
| 10. | Ecosystem & App | Links and user-guide for ‘Crust Apps’ and other platforms within or surrounding the Crust Network ecosystem. |  

We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Crust Network dashboard by April 2023.

Thereafter, we will maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as required by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/  

### Milestone 2 — Maintenance

**Estimated Duration:** 12 months continuous \
**FTE:**  0.5 \
**Costs:** 1,320 USDT

| 1. | Maintenance & Curation | Continuous daily maintenance and curation of content of the dashboard by a specialist over a year. |  

## Future Plans

We are in the process of applying for grants to further develop our app and dashboard. More than a dozen projects have already approved to fund us and we are currently in the process of building or have already released their dashboards. You can see the ones already released at https://app.alphaday.com/ to get a brief idea of how https://app.alphaday.com/b/crustnetwork would look.

In addition to building the Crust Network dashboard, we will be constantly monitoring and improving existing features on Alphaday and adding new widgets and features as we go along. These enhancements will automatically apply to the Crust Dashboard.

In terms of numbers: \
We’ve been growing MAU 40% month-on-month with minimal marketing as we wanted to build a solid and stable product before scaling up our marketing but we expect to reach 10k MAU by March and overall our goal is to 10x our MAU every year.

Considering Crust Network has 113K twitter followers and using this as a very crude proxy for community size, we would consider it a success if we could serve at least 1% of them on a monthly basis (1.13K MAU).


## Additional Information 

If we get a grant we will start working on the board immediately and we should have it ready within 2 months. Once we’ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that Crust Network stakeholders truly love to use.
