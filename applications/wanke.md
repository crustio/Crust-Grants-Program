# Crust Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** wanke  common Distributed storage file module for NFT build on crust

* **Team Name:**  wanke develope team 

* **Payment Address:** 0x85546D1d447cB70dbFb736f567CCF61BBe7Ca336

* **Overview**
NFT market has many NFT reated files like meta data,txt file，picture file and video files。 
so it need a very good decentralization storage file system to store this file, and we think crust one of the most fitable solutions at this time.and we build a common   Distributed storage file module for NFT.so that each NFT project can use this module to implement Crust in their NFT project.


A project name

wanke  common Distributed storage file module for NFT build on crust

A brief description of your project. 

build a common  Distributed storage file module for NFT.so that each NFT project can use this module to implement Crust in their NFT project.

An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Crust.            

the goods on NFT market  both have some metadata for indciate their uniqueness,and also have some video,audio,and picture need to storage on distributed storage system just like crust.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.           

We been involved in decentralized storage service for more than three years.and we beleive there will be some great project be born on crust and ipfs and so on.we decide to do some great thing in this time.


* **Project Details**

the module's technology stack

the frondend:vue.js,the backend:nodejs,the smart contracts written by Solidity,Truffle,Web3

there will be a sdk and demo of how to upload and download file from crust for use of NFT,and deploye it to smart contracts.

Ecosystem Fit

We support the GPL open source protocol

Help us locate your project in the Crust landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 

our porject is a user based application in the crust ecosystem

What need(s) does your project meet?

our porject has meet the needs:my work is just belong to myself. not  other Centralized network platform.only myself has the right to operate it.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the IPFS/Crust ecosystem?

until now ,it's none.
