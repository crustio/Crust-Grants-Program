## User Based Applications
To develop more applications & scenarios for Crust.
Components |Existing Projects|Potentially Interesting Projects|
|:----|:----|:----|
|NFT|  [SinsoGetway](https://github.com/Sinsogetway), [WankeNFT](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/wanke.md)  | The general NFT minting tool for NFT exchanges, which helps to stores NFT offchain data in Crust Network|
|Website hosting tools| [IPFS-Crust-Pinner](https://github.com/crustio/ipfs-crust-pinner)   | CI/CD tools that can automatically host websites on Crust|
|Content storage and delivery| [SkyeKiwi Protocol](http://skye.kiwi/), [CruDrive](https://github.com/crudrive), [Socbay](http://socbay.io), [CruTransfer](https://crutransfer.me/#/home), [Box](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/box.md), [Klikli](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/klikli.md)   | Accelerated and secured P2P-CDNs; Cloud storage platform based on Crust|
|Decentralized Pinning Service|    |Helping users to pin their files in Crust network; Help people store and host important public data |

### Showcases and Scenarios
#### Website Hosting
* Decentralized website hosting, for example, [Decentralized Uniswap Interface hosting on Crust/IPFS](https://medium.com/crustnetwork/decentralized-uniswap-interface-hosting-on-ipfs-18a78d1209ac)

#### Off-Chain Data Storage
* Integrate Crust with NFT Exchanges and NFT minting tools
* Integrate Crust with decentralized full-node data storage solutions
  
#### Accelerated Content Delivery
* Integrate Crust with decentralized video websites and social media platforms
