# Crust Grants Program


## Grants Program Benefits
By joining the Crust Grants Program, you and your team will have following benefits that will strengthen your project growth and development.

## Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances to get accepted if:

- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. We ask you to provide the GitHub profiles of all team members as part of your application and will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full funcionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3 or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/main/README.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, *written* documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product. If your team's background is purely technical, consider hiring a freelance or part-time technical writer as part of the grant.

### Project ideas
An overview of existing projects in the Crust Technology Stack along with broad project ideas we would potentially be interested in funding can be found [here](crust_stacks.md). 
If you have a **good concept of the technical challenges** that your idea entails and would like feedback before applying, you can send us an [email](CrustNetwork@gmail.com) and tell us about it.

## Support

The scope of our Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources. 


### DCF Grants Committee

The DCF(Decentralized Cloud Foundation) Grants Committee consists of the technical experts from DCF, and is responsible for evaluating grant applications and providing feedback on these.

## Application Process

### 1. Application

1. [Fork](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/fork) this repository.

2. In the newly created fork, create acopy of the [applications/application_template]([applications/application_template.md](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/blob/main/applications/applicaiton_template.md)) under the directory `applications/`. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
3. Name the new file after your project:`project_name.md`.
4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review.
5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain *one new file* — the Markdown file you created from the template.
6. Sign off on the [terms and conditions]() as a Contributor License Agreement. You might need to reload the pull request to see its comment.

### 2. Application Review

1. DCF Grants Committee will issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments need to be included in the application. **You may address feedback by modifying your application directly and leaving a comment** once you're done.
3. The application is accepted when all requested changes are addressed, the terms and conditions have been agreed upon.
### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment

Milestones are to be delivered on the Grant Milestone Delivery repository. You can find the delivery process [here](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grant-Milestone-Delivery).
